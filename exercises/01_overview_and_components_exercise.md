## Exercise 1 - Create Your Own React App

**Goal:** We set up our own React app, which we will use as a basis for a memory game that we will implement throughout this workshop.

### Steps
1. Go to `https://codesandbox.io` and log in.

2. Click on "Create"
    * Select "React Typescript"

3. Have a look at the generated files:
    * root folder 
    * **public** folder 
    * **src** folder 

4. Try to change something and see the result!

5. Write your own "Hello World" component

6. To work together with your teammates, enable live collaboration at menu item "Live" on the left.

Everyone in the group should now be able to see and edit the Code Sandbox!
